# Data Synchronization and Storage

This document explains how data is synchronized, stored, and secured in the Mobile Budget App.

## Data Storage Architecture

The Mobile Budget App employs a hybrid storage approach to ensure data availability and security:

- **Local Storage**: For offline capability and fast access
- **Server Database**: For data persistence and cross-device synchronization
- **Caching Layer**: For performance optimization

### Database Schema

The app's data is organized into several core tables:

- **Users**: User account information
- **Expenses**: Transaction records for spending
- **Income**: Earnings and revenue records
- **Budgets**: Budget configurations and limits
- **Categories**: Expense and income categorization
- **Inventory**: Asset tracking information
- **Receipts**: Scanned receipt data and images

## Synchronization Process

### Client-Server Synchronization

Data synchronization between client and server follows these steps:

1. **Authentication**: Verify user credentials before any data transfer
2. **Change Detection**: Identify records that have been modified locally
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve conflicts between local and server data
4. **Data Transfer**: Upload local changes and download server updates
5. **Validation**: Ensure data integrity after synchronization

### Offline Capabilities

The app maintains functionality when offline:

- **Local Operations**: All core features work without internet connection
- **Data Queuing**: Changes are queued for later synchronization
- **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connection is restored

### Multi-Device Synchronization

The app supports using multiple devices with the same account:

- **Real-time Updates**: Changes on one device reflect on others
- **Session Management**: Handling concurrent sessions
- **Device Registration**: Secure device association with accounts

## Data Security

### At-Rest Encryption

Data stored on devices and servers is protected:

- **Local Storage Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted on the device
- **Database Encryption**: Server-side encryption for database contents
- **Backup Encryption**: Secure encryption of backup files

### In-Transit Security

Data transmitted between client and server is secured:

- **HTTPS/TLS**: Encrypted communication channels
- **API Authentication**: Token-based API security
- **Request Signing**: Additional validation of API requests

### Data Privacy

The app implements several privacy protection features:

- **Data Minimization**: Only collecting necessary information
- **Local Processing**: Processing sensitive data on-device when possible
- **Anonymization**: Removing identifying information from analytics data

## Backup and Recovery

### Automated Backups

The system performs regular backups:

- **Scheduled Backups**: Regular server-side data backups
- **Incremental Backups**: Efficient partial backup approach
- **Retention Policy**: Maintaining backup history for recovery

### User-Initiated Backups

Users can create and manage their own backups:

- **Manual Backup**: On-demand backup creation
- **Export Options**: Various formats for exported data
- **Cloud Storage**: Option to save backups to cloud services

### Recovery Options

In case of data loss, users can recover their information:

- **Account Recovery**: Restoring from server backups
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restoring to specific dates
- **Data Import**: Restoring from user-created backups

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

The app uses strategic caching to improve performance:

- **Local Cache**: Frequently accessed data stored locally
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart refreshing of outdated cache
- **Prefetching**: Anticipatory loading of likely-needed data

### Data Pagination

For handling large datasets efficiently:

- **Lazy Loading**: Loading data as needed
- **Windowing**: Rendering only visible portions of large lists
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Progressively loading more data

### Compression

To minimize storage and bandwidth usage:

- **Data Compression**: Reducing size of transmitted data
- **Image Optimization**: Efficient storage of receipt images and attachments
- **Batch Operations**: Grouping API calls to reduce overhead
